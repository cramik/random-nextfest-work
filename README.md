# random-nextfest-work

Random python scripting work I did to try to keep up with the leaderboard for Steam's Next Fest 2022 June Edition badge on SteamDB. In the end, ended up only placing #35 because I missed some demos early on that got removed. Includes some half done work with Windows API and SteamClient API. Python scripts in "sub" folders make batch requests to SteamDB and are very likely to get your IP temporarily banned from SteamDB's servers
